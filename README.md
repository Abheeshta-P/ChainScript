<h1 align="center"> 🔗 ChainScript: Blockchain in TypeScript</h1>


## 🧠 Introduction  

**ChainScript** is a JavaScript-based blockchain implementation designed to help you **learn** how blockchains work.  
It focuses on core concepts:

- 🧱 **Blocks**: Data containers that store information. Each block holds a batch of transactions and links to the previous block.
- 💸 **Transactions**: Records representing the transfer of value or actions within the blockchain.
- ✅ **Chain Validation**: Ensures the integrity and consistency of the blockchain by verifying the links and transactions.


## 🌐 Understanding Blockchain  

### What is a Blockchain?  
A **blockchain** is a special kind of data structure:  
- 📜 Acts as a decentralized, distributed, and immutable ledger.  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Maintained by a network of participants (no single authority).  
- 🔒 Highly resistant to tampering using cryptographic techniques.  
- 🧱 Organized into linked blocks, ensuring data integrity.

This makes blockchain technology perfect for secure, transparent applications like cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin) and many more!  


## ⚙️ How ChainScript Works 

| Component | Description |
|:---|:---|
| 🧱 **Blocks** | Each block contains a timestamp, transactions, previous block hash, and its own hash. |
| 💸 **Transactions** | Represent changes or value transfers. |
| ⛓️ **Blockchain** | A sequence of linked blocks starting with the "Genesis Block." |
| 🔒 **Hashing** | Uses SHA256 cryptographic hashing to ensure block immutability. |
| ✅ **Chain Validation** | Ensures that the blockchain remains tamper-proof and consistent. |


## 🛠 Tech Stack  

| Technology | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| 📜 **JavaScript/TypeScript** | Core programming language |
| ⚙️ **Node.js** | Backend runtime environment |
| **Express.js** (Optional) | API server for the blockchain |
| ⚛️ **React / Next.js** (Optional) | Frontend frameworks for building the UI |
| 🔐 **Crypto-js** | Hashing and cryptographic operations |
